# network
A small suite of tools written in Python to help see who and/or what is on your network.

My name is Caleb. I am a Reddit moderator on /r/lockpicking and http://ninjacache.com so go check those awesome places out. 

I made this repo mainly because I was bored and didn't want to do homework. So use this stuff as you please. Just don't do something
stupid with my tools. I take no responsibility if you scan something you shouldn't with this.
